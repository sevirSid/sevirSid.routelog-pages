    <h1>RouteLog Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 6, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        RouteLog ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our route tracking application handles your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        RouteLog collects the following information solely for the purpose of providing route tracking functionality:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> GPS coordinates to track and record your routes</li>
        <li><strong>Route Information:</strong> Distance, duration, and timestamps of your tracked routes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>
        All data collected by RouteLog is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong>. We use this information exclusively to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Display your current location on the map</li>
        <li>Record and save your routes</li>
        <li>Show your route history and statistics</li>
        <li>Provide route replay and analysis features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All your location data and route information is stored exclusively on your device</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Backup:</strong> We do not upload, sync, or store your data on any external servers</li>
        <li><strong>No Data Transmission:</strong> Your location data is never transmitted to us or any third parties</li>
        <li><strong>Your Control:</strong> You have complete control over your data and can delete it at any time through the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        RouteLog does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. We do not share any information with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Location Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        RouteLog requires location permissions to function properly:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>"When In Use":</strong> To track your route while the app is active</li>
        <li><strong>"Always" (Background):</strong> To continue tracking routes when the app is in the background</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can modify these permissions at any time in your device settings. Denying location access will prevent the app from tracking routes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        Your route data is retained on your device until you choose to delete it. You can delete individual routes or all data through the app's settings.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        RouteLog does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The app is designed for general use and does not target children.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data at any time through the app</li>
        <li>Delete individual routes or all data</li>
        <li>Revoke location permissions through device settings</li>
        <li>Uninstall the app to remove all associated data</li>
    </ul>
